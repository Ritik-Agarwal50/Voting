key design choices and features:

1.Owner Privileges: The contract includes an owner address, and functions like onlyOwner modifier, ensuring that certain actions can only be performed by the owner for administrative control.

2.Voting State: The votingOpen state variable tracks whether the voting is open or closed, and a modifier onlyDuringVoting ensures that certain functions can only be called when voting is open.

3.Voter and Candidate Structs: Voter and Candidate structs are defined to store relevant information about voters and candidates, promoting structured data organization.

4.Mapping for Voters: The voters mapping maintains information about whether an address is registered, has voted, and the candidate ID for the vote.

5.Candidates Array: The candidates array stores information about each candidate, including their name and vote count.

6.Events Logging: Events like VoterRegistered, CandidateAdded, VoteCasted, and VotingClosed are emitted, enabling external systems to listen and respond to contract activities.

7.Modifiers for Access Control: Modifiers like onlyRegisteredVoter, onlyOnce, and onlyDuringVoting enforce access control rules, preventing unauthorized actions.

8.Constructor Initialization: The contract constructor initializes the owner and sets the initial state of voting to open.

9.Registration and Voting Functions: The contract provides functions for voter registration (registerVoter), candidate addition (addCandidate), and vote casting (vote). These functions include appropriate checks and emit events.

10.Closing Voting: The closeVoting function, restricted to the owner, allows for closing the voting process once completed.

11.Results Retrieval: The getResults function returns an array of candidates with their respective vote counts, but only if voting is closed.

12.Getters: Additional getter functions (isVotingOpen, getVoter, and getCandidate) are provided for external systems to query the contract's state.
